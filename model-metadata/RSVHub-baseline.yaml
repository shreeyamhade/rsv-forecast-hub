methods_long: "Flat baseline model. The last observed value from the target dataset is the median forward projection. Prospective uncertainty is based on the preceding timeseries. This is the standard baseline model used by the CDC Forecast Hubs. It is implemented using the `cdc_baseline_forecaster()` function from the `epipredict` R package. https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict/reference/cdc_baseline_forecaster.html"
